🎯 Project Title: Task Management App (React + FastAPI + MongoDB Atlas cloud database)

📌 Description:

The Task Management App is a full-stack web application designed to help users efficiently manage their daily tasks. It is built using React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB Atlas as the cloud-based NoSQL database. This project demonstrates a modern, scalable, and modular approach to full-stack development with a clear separation of concerns , a secure authentication flow and RESTful API architecture.

Users can register, log in, and manage tasks securely by create, update, mark as complete/pending, and delete tasks, with all task data stored securely in MongoDB Atlas—enabling persistent, cloud-based access across devices.

The application features a clean and responsive user interface, seamless real-time interactions, and properly configured CORS and environment settings and authentication using JWT tokens with HttpOnly cookies for enhanced security. It serves as a strong example of a production-ready full-stack application with modern web technologies.
